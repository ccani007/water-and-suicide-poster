abstract = {Background
Stressful life events are a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behaviour, but the strength and nature of this association is unclear. This review examined the prospective relationship between stressful life events and subsequent suicidal ideation and behaviours.
Methods
Five databases were searched from inception to April 2019. Eligible studies included observational, quantitative longitudinal cohort studies with adult or adolescent samples. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to examine the prospective relationship between stressful life events and subsequent suicidal ideation and behaviours. Sub-group analyses examined moderating factors.
Results
Eight studies were identified in the systematic review, and seven studies comprising 2,639 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Six studies investigated suicidal ideation and one investigated suicidal behaviours. Stressful life events were associated with a 37% higher odds of subsequently reported suicidal ideation and behaviours combined (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.70), and a 45% increased risk for suicidal ideation (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.75). This association was stronger in males, young adults, and studies with shorter term follow-up.
Limitations
The analyses indicated statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 76. 48, 95% CI: 55.0 to 87.7%) and there was evidence of publication bias.
Conclusions
Stressful life events were shown to increase the risk of subsequently reported suicidal ideation and behaviours. These findings suggest that the experience of stressful life events should be incorporated into clinical suicide risk assessments and suicide interventions could include a component on developing resilience and adaptive coping to stressful life events.}

abstract = {Background
We examined the fast food consumption-suicide attempt relationship among 105,061 adolescents aged 12–15 years from 32 countries.
Methods
This study was based on cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), and included 4 low-income, 13 lower middle-income, 9 upper middle-income, and 6 high-income countries. Data on past 7-day fast food consumption and 12-month suicide attempts were collected. The association between fast food consumption and suicide attempts was investigated with multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis while adjusting for sex, age, food insecurity (proxy of socioeconomic status), alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, obesity, carbonated soft drink consumption, and fruit and vegetable consumption.
Results
Overall, the prevalence of fast food consumption was high (53.5%) and the proportion of suicide attempts was higher among consumers of fast food compared to non-consumers (11.8% vs. 8.3%). Of the 32 countries included in the study, a positive association between fast food consumption and suicide attempts was found in 26 countries although this was not statistically significant in all countries. The pooled OR (95% CI) based on a meta-analysis was 1.31 (1.17–1.46).
Limitations
Since this was a cross-sectional study, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about causality or temporality in the associations assessed.
Conclusions
Fast food consumption is positively associated with suicide attempts in adolescents. Further research of longitudinal design is needed to confirm/refute our findings and explore the potential underlying mechanisms.}

abstract = {Background
Although exercise may positively impact those with mental or other medical illnesses, there is a lack of understanding on how it influences suicidal ideation or risk.
Methods
We conducted a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO from inception to June 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating exercise and suicidal ideation in subjects with mental or physical conditions were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation. We assessed bias of studies with risk of bias 2 tool.
Results
We identified 17 RCTs encompassing 1021 participants. Depression was the most included condition (71 %, k = 12). Mean follow up was 10.0 weeks (SD = 5.2). Post-intervention suicidal ideation (SMD = -1.09, CI -3.08–0.90, p = 0.20, k = 5) was not significantly different between exercise and control groups. Suicide attempts were significantly reduced in participants randomized to exercise interventions as compared to inactive controls (OR = 0.23, CI 0.09–0.67, p = 0.04, k = 2). Fourteen studies (82 %) were at high risk of bias.
Limitations
This meta-analysis is limited by few, underpowered and heterogenous studies.
Conclusion
Overall, our meta-analysis did not find a significant decrease in suicidal ideation or mortality between exercise and control groups. However, exercise did significantly decrease suicide attempts. Results should be considered preliminary, and more and larger studies assessing suicidality in RCTs testing exercise are needed.}

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine sex differences in the association between sexual violence victimization and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adolescents. Data for this study came from the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. An analytic sample of 10,475 adolescents aged 14–18 years (52.3% female) was analyzed. We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between sexual violence victimization and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. We adjusted for the complexity of the sampling design and handled missing data using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations. About 18% of adolescents experienced suicidal ideation and 7.5% attempted suicide during the past 12 months. About one in ten adolescents (15.5% of females versus 3.6% of males) experienced sexual violence. Controlling for other factors, the odds of reporting suicidal ideation were 1.86 times higher for females who experienced sexual violence (AOR=1.86, 95% CI=1.44–2.42) when compared to their non-victimized counterparts. Females who experienced sexual violence had almost double the odds of making a suicide attempt (AOR=1.94, 95% CI=1.43–2.65) whereas males who experienced sexual violence had more than threefold higher odds of making a suicide attempt (AOR=3.32, 95% CI=2.17–5.08). Understanding the association between sexual violence victimization and suicidal behaviors could contribute to early identification of adolescents who may be at risk of engaging in suicidal behaviors.}
